## Overview

The Candidate Application Platform is a ReactJS-based web application built with Redux for state management, CSS for styling, and Material UI for components. It allows users to browse job listings, apply filters, and implement infinite scroll for loading additional job listings.

## Requirements

### Functionality

- Job Cards: Each job listing is displayed as a card containing job title, company name, location, job description, experience required, and apply button/link.
- Filters: Implemented filters allow users to refine job listings based on various criteria such as minimum experience, company name, location, remote/on-site, tech stack, role, and minimum base pay.
- Infinite Scroll: Implemented infinite scroll loads additional job listings automatically as the user scrolls down the page.
- Responsive Design: The platform is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
